# A Final Push

## COMP4441 Final Project

*by Lauren & Tony*

For this final video, we felt extra adventurous and went for a fully original MV in the minimalistic style. Using only flat shapes and the power of motion to tell tell the story.

But the most special thing, is that we are using [***Motion Canvas***](https://motioncanvas.io/), a brand new **Open Source** animation software. Everything visually are driven by `code`.

It is obviously not as fancy and feature rich as some other video editing software, but for some tasks, this tool really shines.

### To try it out:

*Make sure that Node.js version 16 or greater is installed on your machine.*

1. Clone the Repository
2. Run the following to install npm packages
```
npm install
```

3. Start the editor with the following
```
npm run serve
```

4. The editor can be accessed by visiting http://localhost:9000/
